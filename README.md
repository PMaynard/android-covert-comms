# GSoC Proposal

I propose to implement an covert communication channel for android devices. A covert communication channel is a technique which exploits the existing firewalls and IDS. It does this by disguising the actual data packet as another.   


In Russ Rogers’ talk ”The Keys to the Kingdom” [1] he defines a covert channel as:

>”Any communication channel that can be exploited by a process to transfer informa-
>tion in a manner that violates the systems security policy.”
